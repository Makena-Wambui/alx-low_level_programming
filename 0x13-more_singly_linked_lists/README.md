Requirements

General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:

/**
 * struct listint_s - singly linked list
 * @n: integer
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 * 
 */
typedef struct listint_s
{
    int n;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;

Question 0
Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_listint(const listint_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
You are allowed to use printf

QUESTION 1
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.

Prototype: size_t listint_len(const listint_t *h);

QUESTION 2
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

Prototype: listint_t *add_nodeint(listint_t **head, const int n);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed

QUESTION 3
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.

Prototype: listint_t *add_nodeint_end(listint_t **head, const int n);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed

QUESTION 4
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

Prototype: listint_t *insert_nodeint_at_index(listint_t **head, unsigned int idx, int n);
where idx is the index of the list where the new node should be added. Index starts at 0
Returns: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
if it is not possible to add the new node at index idx, do not add the new node and return NULL

QUESTION 5
Write a function that frees a listint_t list.

Prototype: void free_listint(listint_t *head);

QUESTION 6
Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
void free_listint2(listint_t **head);

QUESTION 7
Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head node’s data (n).

Prototype: int pop_listint(listint_t **head);
if the linked list is empty return 0

QUESTION 8
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.

Prototype: int delete_nodeint_at_index(listint_t **head, unsigned int index);
where index is the index of the node that should be deleted. Index starts at 0
Returns: 1 if it succeeded, -1 if it failed

QUESTION 9
Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

Prototype: listint_t *get_nodeint_at_index(listint_t *head, unsigned int index);
where index is the index of the node, starting at 0
if the node does not exist, return NULL

QUESTION 10
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.

Prototype: int sum_listint(listint_t *head);
if the list is empty, return 0

QUESTION 11
Write a function that prints a listint_t linked list.

Prototype: size_t print_listint_safe(const listint_t *head);
Returns: the number of nodes in the list
This function can print lists with a loop
You should go through the list only once
If the function fails, exit the program with status 98

EXPLANATION OF QUESTION 11
The main difference between the print_listint_safe function and a regular print_listint function lies in the ability to handle lists with loops. The print_listint_safe function is designed to detect if a linked list contains a loop and print the nodes up to the point where the loop is detected. It achieves this by using Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm).
