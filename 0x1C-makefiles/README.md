Makefiles are a way to specify how to compile and build software projects, particularly those composed of multiple source code files. They are commonly used in Unix-based systems but can also be used on other platforms with tools like GNU Make.

A Makefile contains rules that specify how to build executable programs from source code files. Each rule typically consists of a target, dependencies, and commands. When you run the make command, it reads the Makefile and executes the necessary commands to update the target files based on their dependencies and the rules defined in the Makefile.

For example:

# Define variables
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

# Define targets and their dependencies
all: program

program: main.o utils.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o program main.o utils.o

# Define how to compile source files
main.o: main.c utils.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

utils.o: utils.c utils.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c utils.c

# Define a clean target to remove generated files
clean:
    rm -f program *.o



Makefiles are a way to specify how to compile and build software projects, particularly those composed of multiple source code files. They are commonly used in Unix-based systems but can also be used on other platforms with tools like GNU Make.

A Makefile contains rules that specify how to build executable programs from source code files. Each rule typically consists of a target, dependencies, and commands. When you run the make command, it reads the Makefile and executes the necessary commands to update the target files based on their dependencies and the rules defined in the Makefile.

Here's a basic example of a Makefile:

make
Copy code
# Define variables
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

# Define targets and their dependencies
all: program

program: main.o utils.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o program main.o utils.o

# Define how to compile source files
main.o: main.c utils.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

utils.o: utils.c utils.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c utils.c

# Define a clean target to remove generated files
clean:
    rm -f program *.o
In this example:

CC and CFLAGS are variables used to specify the compiler and compiler flags.

all is a target that depends on the program target. When you run make all, it will build the program.


program is a target that depends on main.o and utils.o object files. It specifies how to link them into an executable.


main.o and utils.o are targets specifying how to compile main.c and utils.c into object files.


clean is a target that specifies how to remove generated files when you run make clean.


Makefiles are powerful tools for automating the build process, managing dependencies, and ensuring that only the necessary files are rebuilt when source files are modified. They are widely used in software development to simplify the process of compiling and building complex projects.


By default, Makefile targets are "file targets" - they are used to build files from other files. Make assumes its target is a file, and this makes writing Makefiles relatively easy:

foo: bar
  create_one_from_the_other foo bar

However, sometimes, you want your Makefile to run commands that do not represent physical files in the file system. Good examples of this are the common targets "clean" and "all". Chances are this isn't the case, but you may potentially have a file named clean in your main directory. In such a case Make will be confused because by default the clean target would be associated with this file and Make will only run it when the file doesn't appear to be up-to-date with regards to its dependencies.

These special targets are called phony and you can explicitly tell Make they're not associated with files, e.g.:

.PHONY: clean
clean:
  rm -rf *.o

Now make clean will run as expected even if you do have a file named clean.
