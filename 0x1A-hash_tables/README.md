What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
What are the most common use cases of hash tables

Tasks
0. >>> ht = {}
Write a function that creates a hash table.

Prototype: hash_table_t *hash_table_create(unsigned long int size);
where size is the size of the array
Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table
If something went wrong, your function should return NULL

1. djb2
Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.

Prototype: unsigned long int hash_djb2(const unsigned char *str);

2. key -> index
mandatory
Write a function that gives you the index of a key.

Prototype: unsigned long int key_index(const unsigned char *key, unsigned long int size);
where key is the key
and size is the size of the array of the hash table
This function should use the hash_djb2 function that you wrote earlier
Returns the index at which the key/value pair should be stored in the array of the hash table
You will have to use this hash function for all the next tasks
